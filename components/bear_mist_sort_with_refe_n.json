{"reviews": ["The mist is produced silently and without any annoying lights on the machine  (only one weak light to signal \"on.\")  I like the one-gallon tank for simplicity of refills.  But the machine allows for the production of lots of slime ..you'll need a small paint brush or something to get into the crevices to clean it out thoroughly.  Other than that, it's a pretty good device for its small size.", "I bought this to replace a 3 month old digital unit that was beeping loudly and randomly in the middle of the night. This is very quiet and easy to fill and clean. It's so quiet I often forget to turn it off in the morning. The only downside is that is doesn't put out as much mist as my old one due to a smaller spout opening, but it's a tradeoff for not being woken up in the middle of the night by beeping.", "It is now April 01, 2024 anf still no one has had the professionalism to respond.  By the time it is all said and done, I am stuck with a useless product and out approximately $80.  You are $80 richer and unloaded a defective product on a customer.  Are you proud of your low class company.  product is not producing a mist after less than 2 months of nightly use.  All instructions were followed.  Tried to email company x3 but no one has bothered to contact me about my concerns  so what are you going to do about it.  I bought the extended warranty  and here it sits the last day of 2023 and still no response  from this obviously less than trustworthy company", "Worked perfectly until eventually it started throwing less and less mist, now it doesn’t work at all, tank is full and the empty light is on. Great product for little time", "I cleaned mine at least one a week and it still broke. I always had issues with the mist wasn’t comming out or the water just leaks straight out of the bottom. My plants and frogs are upset lol!", "The mist is not very adjustable. It has a knob to adjust the amount of mist but there isn't much difference between high and low. You are also supposed to be able to adjust the direction of the mist, but that doesn't work well either."], "reference": [6, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0], "score": [-0.10000000149011612, -0.10000000149011612, -0.20000000298023224, -0.5, -0.4000000059604645, -0.06666666766007741]}
