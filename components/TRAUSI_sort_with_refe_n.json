{"reviews": ["I don't like things going in my ear because I've always had ear issues. These will be nice and comfortable and easy to use. They're subtle and open ear so I can also hear what's going on around me. I like them a lot", "One of my gripes sometimes with earphones that are not in-ear is that they don't give you the same quality of sound and the same experience. However, in-ear earphones don't work for me. Constantly falling out, hurting my ear, etc. These are a welcome change. The hook around the ear ensures they are stable and won't fall out (I have tested this by shaking my head like a crazy person). I do have smaller ears than most people so I was very skeptical that the other part would fit, but it does. I do have a little discomfort but I think that will change as I get used to them. Overall, I recommend these.", "These headphones are better than expected. It's hard to find good earbuds that don't actually go into your ear. The sounds is great and it has alot of features where you don't physically need your phone to play/pause or skip a song. They seem pretty sturdy I like that the case charges the headphones automatically."], "reference": [0, 0, 0], "score": [-0.20000001043081284, -0.20000001043081284, -0.10000000149011612]}
